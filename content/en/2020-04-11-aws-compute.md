# Amazon EC2

EC2 is arguably the first compute service that you will encounter when working with AWS. It allows you to deploy virtual servers within your AWS environment and most people will require an EC2 instance within their environment as a part of at least one of their solutions. There are a number of elements in creating your EC2 instance, which I want to break down and explain.

AMIs, Amazon Machine Images. These are essentially templates of pre-configured EC2 instances which allow you to quickly launch a new EC2 instance based on the configuration within the AMI. 

## types:

* On-Demand instances
* Reserved instances
* Scheduled instances
* Spot instances
* On-Demand Capacity Reservations
